# FreeCodeCamp-Projects

## Contains all 5 coding projects from the Machine Learning with Python course from FreeCodeCamp

### Rock Paper Scissors: A program that plays matches against four different bots winning at least 60% of the games in each match.
### Cat and Dog Image Classifier: A convolutional neural network with help of TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.
### Book Recommendation Engine using KKN: A K-Nearest Neighbors powered book recommendation algorithm that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument.
