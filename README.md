# FreeCodeCamp-Projects

## Contains all 5 coding projects from the Machine Learning with Python course from FreeCodeCamp

1.  __Rock Paper Scissors__: A program that plays matches against four different bots winning at least 60% of the games in each match.
2. __Cat and Dog Image Classifier__: A convolutional neural network with the help of TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.
3. __Book Recommendation Engine using KKN__: A K-Nearest Neighbors powered book recommendation algorithm that takes a book title (from the dataset) as an argument and returns a list of 5 similar books with their distances from the book argument.
4. __Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator__: Use of a regression algorithm to predict healthcare costs.
5. __Neural Network SMS Text Classifier__: A machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam".
